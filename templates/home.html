    <h1 class="display-5 text-center">The Verses of Middle Earth</h1><br>
    <p class="blockquote" id="tldr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">TLDR: </span>This website is a passion project with a straightforward goal: to catalog all the verses from J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle-earth, including poems, songs, incantations, and other writings in verse rather than prose, and compile them in one place. Why is this a passion project? If you're curious, feel free to read on; otherwise, you can jump right in by clicking on "Verses" in the menu bar to begin exploring. One quick note: I have added (and will continue to add) annotations to some of the texts. If you see a word or phrase with a faint dotted underline, simply hover over it to read the annotation.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">For those who have longer attention spans, more time, or nothing better to do: </span>When I was in 4th grade (a long, long, long time ago), Ms. Brigham would read to us every day after lunch. One of the books she read was The Hobbit. For weeks, we'd spend the half hour or so after lunch with the lights off, heads on our desks, listening to the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and a company of dwarves as they journeyed to reclaim the lost treasure hoarded in the Lonely Mountain. After that first encounter, I wasn't a superfan, but a seed had been planted. It would be nine more years (my freshman year in college) before I learned that the tale of Bilbo's big adventure was but one of many stories about this rich and beautiful and dangerous and magical and altogether fascinating world. But it wasn't until 2006 that I read The Lord of the Rings. I was blown away. Now, I wanted to read all of it. Everything. But I was also busy. Very busy. Very, very busy. Career. Young family. You know the drill.</p>

    <p>Let's face it: trying to read all of Middle Earth literature is a commitment, one that's tough to make when you're, you know, busy. However, in the last few years, things happened. My kids became adults. I, along with the rest of the world, got to spend an inordinate amount of time at home (think 2020). And I reached a point in my career where I could enjoy a little more free time. So, I took up software development and a very intentional approach to reading. The first doesn't matter much here (except for the existence of this site as a thing on the internet). The second, however ...</p>

    <p>Recently, two areas have dominated my reading: poetry and Tolkien. I was never a poetry fan--it all seemed too symbolic or abstract for me. While I easily reveled in the sublime prose of Charles Dickens or the smart and labyrinthine tales of Umberto Eco, poetry just wasn't approachable. Then, I read Coleridge's Rime of the Ancient Mariner. Something clicked, and I was hooked. My poetry library went from non-existent to being measured in shelves.</p>

    <p>But what about Tolkien? As literary world builders go, there is none better. The richness of Middle Earth's physical world and its comprehensive social, historical, and supernatural backdrop, complete with its lore and tradition(s), are enough to draw anyone into another place and time entirely. Compelling characters, stunning landscapes, stories that touch the deepest parts of the human condition—it's difficult not to love Tolkien.
    </p>

    <p>So, what do poetry and Tolkien have to do with each other? Tolkien was a poet and was at his finest when he wove verses into his Middle Earth narratives ("verses" meaning all the poems, songs, incantations, etc, that are written in verse rather than prose). These verses are not fillers or asides but integral parts of the story, often providing historical and legendary background to the narrative. They don't just say something about Middle Earth, its people, or its history. They draw us into Middle Earth as participants or, at least, as present spectators watching events unfold live. We're not just reading the words of dwarvish songs; we hear them being sung. We don't just picture the Lonely Mountain in our mind; we feel the heat of the forge, hear the sounds of hammers and anvils and, ultimately, smell the sulfur of dragon fire. Most of all, however, these verses are deeply enchanting.

    <blockquote>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though [Frodo] understood them little, held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice...<br>

    <p>You should know this is by no means a comprehensive collection of all things Middle Earth. In the process of cataloging these verses, it seemed reasonable to include at least minimal information on characters, places, events, and things to round out some context -- no great details, just enough explanation to situate the words. <strong>[These sections are still being built out so please forgive any missing or unuseful information]</strong> There are, however, some excellent online resources that do provide more comprehensive and high quality reference material. In particular, I'd point you to <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net" target="blank">The Tolkien Gateway</a> and <a href="http://lotrproject.com" target="blank">LOTR Project</a> (which has amazing interactive maps and a very interesting section on LOTR statistics -- word frequency, life expectancies, etc).</p>

    <h1 class="display-5 text-center">The Verses of Middle Earth</h1><br>
    <p class="blockquote" id="tldr"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">TLDR: </span>This little site is a passion project with a simple aim: catalog all the verses of J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth (i.e., the poems, songs, incantations, etc., that are written in verse rather than prose) and put them in one place. Why? Well, no good reason. Or bad reason. I just like collections. I guess I like to have things I love at my fingertips (or the click of a mouse). If you want to know why I'm captivated by these verses, read on, or if you want to jump right in, follow the links in the menu bar.</p>

    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 1.25em;">For those who have longer attention spans, more time, or nothing better to do: </span>When I was in 4th grade (a long, long, long time ago) Ms. Brigham would read to us every day after lunch. One of the books she read was <em>The Hobbit</em>. For weeks, we'd spend the half hour or so after lunch with the lights off, heads on our desks, listening to the adventures of Bilbo Baggins and a company of dwarves as they journeyed to reclaim the lost treasure hoarded in the Lonely Mountain. After that first encounter, I was enamored by Middle Earth but not obsessed with it. It would be nine more years before I learned that the tale of Bilbo's big adventure was but one of many stories about this rich and beautiful and dangerous and magical and altogether fascinating world. I'd never heard of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> before my first year in college (remember, this was mostly pre-internet so things we take for granted now could be elusive then). But it wasn't until 2006 that I read <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. I was blown away. But I wasn't obsessed. Not yet. I didn't have the time.</p>

    <p>Let's face it, trying to read all of Middle Earth literature is a commitment, one that's tough to make when you're starting a career and starting a family. However, in the last few years things happened. My kids became adults. I, along with the rest of the world, got to spend an inordinate amount of time at home (think 2020). And I reached a point in my career where I can enjoy a little more free time. So I took up software development and a very intentional approach to reading. The first doesn't matter much to us here (except for the existence of this site as a thing on the internet). The second however ...</p>

    <p>Recently, two areas have dominated by reading: poetry and Tolkien. I was never a poetry fan--it all seemed too symbolic or abstract for me. While I easily reveled in the sublime prose of Charles Dickens or the smart and labyrinthine tales of Umberto Eco, poetry just wasn't approachable. Then I read Coleridge's <em>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em>. Something clicked and I was hooked. My poetry library went from non-existent to a shelf and a half virtually overnight.</p>

    <p>But what about Tolkien? As literary world builders go, there is none better. The richness of Middle Earth's physical world and its comprehensive social, historical, and supernatural backdrop, complete with developed lore and tradition(s) are enough to draw anyone in to another place and time entirely. Compelling characters, stunning landscapes, stories that touch the deepest parts of the human condition; it's difficult not to love Tolkien.</p>

    <p>So what do poetry and Tolkien have to do with each other? Tolkien was a poet and was at his finest when he wove verses into his Middle Earth narratives ("verses" meaning all the poems, songs, incantations, etc that are written in verse rather than prose). These verses are not fillers or asides but rather are integral parts of the story, often providing historical and legendary background to the narrative. They don't just say something about Middle Earth, its people, or history. They draw us in to Middle Earth as participants or, at least, as present specators watching events unfold live. We're not just reading the words of dwarvish songs, we hear them being sung. We don't just picture the Lonely Mountain in our mind, we feel the heat of the forge, hear the sounds of hammers on anvils and, ultimately, smell the sulfur of dragon fire. Most of all, however, these verses are deeply enchanting.</p> 

    <blockquote>At first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in elven-tongues, even though [Frodo] understood them little, held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. There he wandered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then suddenly into a voice...<br>

    <p>You should know this is by no means a comprehensive catalog of all things Middle Earth. In the process of cataloging these verses, it seemed reasonable to include at least minimal information on characters, places, events, and things to round out the context of these verses, but don't look here for detailed information on the Istari or the origins of the palantiri. [These sections are still being built out so please forgive any missing, or non useful information] There are, however, some excellent online resources that do provide more comprehensive and high quality reference material. In particular, I'd point you to <a href="https://tolkiengateway.net" target="blank">The Tolkien Gateway</a> and <a href="http://lotrproject.com" target="blank">LOTR Project</a> (which has amazing interactive maps and a very interesting section on LOTR statistics -- word frequency, life expectancies, etc).</p>

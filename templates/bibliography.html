<h1 class="display-5 text-center">Bibliography</h1>
<br>
<p>I have tried to make it as easy as possible to locate these verses. To that end, I have tried to include book and chapter numbers for all the verses so they can be located without reference to page numbers which vary among editions. I have also provided page numbers for the editions listed below.</p>
<br>
<h1 class="display-6">Illustrated editions from Willilam Morrow</h1>
<p>These are my absolute favorite editions of the three main Middle Earth books. They are beautifully set, sturdy, and include fold out maps as well as many of Tolkien's own illustrations.</p>

<h1 class="display-5 text-center">Bibliography</h1>
<br>
<p>I have tried to make it as easy as possible to locate these verses. To that end, I have tried to include book and chapter numbers for all the verses so they can be located without reference to page numbers which vary among editions. I have also provided page numbers for the editions listed below. And just a quick pedantic note: Lord of the Rings is not technically a trilogy. It is, as Douglas Anderson explains in the [GET INFO] edition, "a single novel, consisting of six books plus appendices, sometimes published in three volumes." The printed edition that I reference is, in fact, a single volume version. However, because most people read it as three separate books, I have included the well-known individual book titles when citing an individual verse's source.</p>

<h1 class="display-6">Illustrated editions from William Morrow</h1>
<p>These are my absolute favorite editions of the three main Middle Earth books. They are beautifully set, sturdy, and include fold out maps as well as many of Tolkien's own illustrations.</p>
